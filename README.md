#### The Turtle Crossing Game is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to guide a turtle safely across a busy highway, avoiding oncoming traffic and reaching the other side.

## Features:
#### Interactive Gameplay : Players control a turtle character using arrow keys to navigate across the screen.
#### Obstacle Avoidance: The game features dynamically moving obstacles, such as cars and trucks, that the player must avoid.
#### Multiple Levels: As players progress, the game increases in difficulty with faster-moving obstacles and narrower gaps between traffic.
#### Score Tracking: Points are awarded for successfully crossing the highway, with higher scores achieved for completing levels quickly and without collisions.
#### User Interface: The game includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) displaying the turtle, vehicles, and other game elements.
## Technologies Used:
#### Python: The game logic and graphics are implemented using Python programming language.
#### Turtle Graphics: The Turtle graphics library is utilized for creating the game's graphical interface and animations.
#### Object-Oriented Programming: Custom Python classes are used to represent game objects and manage game state.
## How to Play:
#### Run the Python script to start the game.
#### Use the arrow keys to move the turtle character up, down, left, or right.
#### Navigate the turtle safely across the highway, avoiding collisions with oncoming vehicles.
#### Reach the other side of the highway to advance to the next level.
#### Repeat steps 2-4 to progress through multiple levels and achieve the highest score possible.
## Inspiration:
#### The Turtle Crossing Game is inspired by classic arcade games such as Frogger, where players must navigate obstacles and hazards to reach a goal. This project serves as both a fun recreational activity and an educational exercise in game development using Python.
